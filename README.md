## FIFA World Cup 2022 Machine Learning

This project focuses on using machine learning to predict the winner of the FIFA World Cup 2022. Football is a sport filled with unpredictability and uncertainty, making it exciting for fans. In this project, historical data from previous World Cups (1930-2018) is utilized to determine the winner and runner-up of each group, leading up to the final match.

### Data Collection and Preparation

The project starts by gathering data on the history of all participating countries in the World Cup from 1930 to 2018. Additionally, data on each group and their respective matches in the group stage is collected to determine the winners and runner-ups. The data is processed and organized for further analysis.

### Methodology - Poisson Distribution

Due to data limitations and the goal of creating a simple machine learning model, the Poisson distribution is chosen as the statistical approach. The Poisson distribution is a discrete probability distribution that describes the number of events occurring within a fixed time interval or region.

To implement the Poisson distribution, the average goals scored and conceded by each national team are calculated. This information is used to determine the lambda (Î») value, which represents the average number of goals in a 90-minute match for each team. By considering goals as events, the probability of scoring a specific number of goals in a match is determined using the Poisson distribution formula.

### Assumptions and Considerations

While implementing the Poisson distribution, certain assumptions are made:

1. The number of events (goals) can be counted.
2. The occurrence of events is independent.
3. The rate at which events occur is constant.

Assumptions 1 and 4 are readily met, while assumptions 2 and 3 are partially true. For this project, it is assumed that these assumptions hold true consistently.

### Model Implementation

The project involves importing necessary libraries and assigning them to respective variables. Data tables containing group data, historical World Cup data, and 2022 World Cup match data are utilized for analysis. The historical data is processed to extract relevant information.

Functions are created to predict the outcome of each match and calculate the points earned by the home and away teams. These functions utilize the Poisson distribution to simulate various match score possibilities and calculate the probabilities. Points are then calculated based on the match outcomes.

### Predicting Group Stage Results

The "predict_points" function is used to predict the points earned by each team in the group stage matches. This function considers the average goals scored and conceded by each team to calculate lambda values and simulate match scores. The accumulated points determine the group winners and runner-ups, which subsequently advance to the knockout stage.

### Predicting Knockout Stage Results

Functions are implemented to predict the winners of the round of 16, quarter-finals, semi-finals, and the final. These functions utilize the "predict_points" function to determine the winners based on the points earned by each team.

### Conclusion

The FIFA World Cup 2022 Machine Learning project utilizes historical data and the Poisson distribution to predict the winner of the tournament. By simulating match scores and calculating probabilities, the project aims to provide insights into the potential outcomes of the tournament. The model considers average goals scored and conceded by each team to make predictions for the group stage, as well as the knockout stage matches leading up to the final.
